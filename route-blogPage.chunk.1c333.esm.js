Let’s start with CommonJS… </p><div><h2>CommonJS what, why and the how?</h2><p><strong>What is it? </strong>CommonJS is a module formatting system. It is a standard for structuring and organizing the JavaScript code and the reason why I was concerned with it was because CJS has heavy influence on <strong>NodeJS’s module management.</strong><p class=\\"tc\\"><img class=\\"blogImg\\" src=\\"/assets/images/confused.gif\\" alt=\\"A confused gif did not load:(\\"></p></p></div><p><strong>What\'s that...a module?</strong> Well a module is just a bit of code encapsulated in a file and exported to another file. Modules focus on a single part of the functionality and remain loosely coupled with other files in an application. This is because there are no global or shared variables between modules, as they only communicate via the module.exports object. Any code that you want to be accessible in another file can be a module..so just say bye to using global variables and giving them complex names for protecting their values from being overridden!</p><br><p><strong>How? \\n</strong>CommonJS wraps each module in a function called \'require\', and includes an object called \'module.exports\', which exports code for availability to be required by other modules. All you have to do is add whatever you want access to other files onto the \'exports\' object and require the module in the dependent file. the syntax for the require function is \\"var someVariable = require(\'moduleID/pathOfModule\');\\". Here’s an example…</p>\\n<pre class=\'code code-javascript\'><code>\\n//In multiply.js\\n\\nfunction multiply (a, b) {\\n  return a * b\\n}\\nmodule.exports = multiply\\n\\n//In someOther.js\\n\\nvar a  =  require(\'multiply.js\').multiply(2,3);\\n\\n</code>\\n</pre>\\n\\n<h2>All about “require”</h2>\\n<p>The module loading mechanism in Node.js is caching the modules on the first require call. It means that every time you use <strong>require(‘multiply.js’)</strong> you will get the same instance of multiply-module, which ensures that the modules are singleton-like and have the same state across your application.</p>\\n<p class=\\"tc\\"><img class=\\"blogImg\\" src=\\"/assets/images/node-js-require-works.png\\" alt=\\"A confused gif did not load:(\\"></p>\\n<p>All these steps are performed whenever we require a module in NodeJS and is pretty self explanatory…but what we need to manipulate a little is the caching part...and yes, one more thing about require is that if the identifier passed to the require function is not a native module or a file reference (beginning with /, ../, ./ or similar), then Node.js will look for installed modules traversing the file system looking for the referenced module in the node_modules folder. </p>\\n<h2>The solution - Inspecting require.cache</h2>\\n<p>When we console.log(require.cache) in a js file requiring a file from another module and run it in node js,it looks something like this..</p>\\n<p class=\\"tc\\"><img class=\\"blogImg\\" src=\\"/assets/images/filledRequire.png\\" alt=\\"Require Obj didn\'t load on your browser..\\"></p>\\n<p>Clearly , require.cache is an object containing multiple nested objects , the key to these nested objects is the filepath which was required in the js-file.In this example <span class=\\"highlight\\">test.js requires a file  data.json</span></p>\\n<p>So the file <span calss=\\"highlight\\">\'/Users/rohangrover/Desktop/nodeTest/data.json\'</span> has been cached..having data  {\\n  \\"someKey\\": \\"someData\\"\\n}\\n</p>\\n<p class=\\"tc\\"><img class=\\"blogImg\\" src=\\"/assets/images/knoweverything.jpg\\" alt=\\"Now you know everything...\\"></p>\\n\\n<p>Well now it is pretty straight forward to figure out what to do next..just delete the file path you want node js to reload with the updated code...<span class=\\"highlight\\">the path needs to be absolute\\n</span></p>\\n\\n<pre class=\'code code-javascript\'><code>\\ndelete require.cache[\'/Users/rohangrover/Desktop/nodeTest/data.json\']\\n</code>\\n</pre>\\n\\n<p>Here is a code snippet that allows you to traverse through the entire project structure, written as event emitter(<a href=\\"https://nodejs.org/api/events.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">What\'s an event emitter?</a>)</p>\\n\\n<pre class=\'code code-javascript\'><code>\\nconst EventEmitter = require(\'events\');\\nclass cacheHandler extends EventEmitter\\n{\\n    parseCachedFiles()\\n    {\\n        let procSucess=true,cn=1,data={\\"files\\":{}};\\n        for(let prop in require.cache)\\n        {\\n            let cacheStatus=this.clearCache(prop);\\n            if(cacheStatus===\\"success\\")\\n            {\\n                data[\\"files\\"][cn] = prop;\\n                cn++;\\n            }\\n            else\\n            {\\n                data[\\"error\\"] = cacheStatus;\\n                procSucess=false;\\n                break;\\n            }\\n      }\\n        if(procSucess)//cache cleaned successfully.\\n        {\\n          console.info(data);\\n        }\\n        else//cache cleaning failed\\n        {\\n          console.error(data);\\n        }\\n    }\\n    clearCache(filePath)\\n    {\\n        try{\\n            delete require.cache[filePath];\\n            return \\"success\\";\\n        }\\n        catch(error)\\n        {\\n            return error\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nmodule.exports = cacheHandler;\\n</code>\\n</pre>\\n\\n<p>Create an instance</p>\\n\\n<pre class=\'code code-javascript\'><code>\\nvar cacheHandler = require(\'./cacheHandler\');\\nvar cData = new cacheHandler();\\ncData.on(\'clearCache\', cData.parseCachedFiles);\\n</code>\\n</pre>\\n\\n<p>Emit it when there is an update in your server code</p>\\n\\n<pre class=\'code code-javascript\'><code>\\n cData.emit(\'clearCache\');\\n</code>\\n</pre>","prevBlogTitle":"","prevBlogUrl":"","nextBlogTitle":"Fascinating Paradoxes","nextBlogUrl":"/blogs/fascinating-paradoxes/"}},"fascinating-paradoxes":{"data":{"content":"<div class=\\"entry\\">       <p>Mathematicians and Physicist sometimes confront problems having two statements that are both true but in general,both cannot be true at the same time.These self-contradicting statements forms a paradox.I first read about them in <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hofstadter\\"><strong>Douglas Hofstadter’s</strong></a>  Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braidand and since then I got more interested in these types of problems.Lets have a look at some of the most enthralling mathematical paradoxes!</p>      <h2 id=\\"zenos-paradox\\">Zeno’s Paradox</h2>      <p>Zeno of Elea proposed four paradoxes in an effort to challenge the accepted notions of space and time.I will be writting about the first of his four famous paradoxes that attacks the notion held by many philosophers of his day that space was infinitely divisible.</p>      <p><strong>Here’s the paradox:</strong>   If Achillies and tortoise had a race and the tortoise was given a head start say a 100 meters and if we suppose that each racer starts running at some constant speed (one very fast and one very slow), then after some finite time, Achilles will have run 100 meters, bringing him to the tortoise’s starting point. During this time, the tortoise has run a much shorter distance, say, 10 meters. It will then take Achilles some further time to run that distance, by which time the tortoise will have advanced farther; and then more time still to reach this third point, while the tortoise moves ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles reaches somewhere the tortoise has been, he still has farther to go. Therefore, because there are an infinite number of points Achilles must reach where the tortoise has already been, he can never overtake the tortoise.</p>      <p class=\\"tc\\"><img class=\\"blogImg\\" src=\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Zeno_Achilles_Paradox.png\\" alt=\\"\\"></p>      <p>However,whatever the paradox might be in a real case scenario Achillies would easily over take the tortoise but why does the above statement also seems about just right?</p>      <p>As a matter of fact any person running from point A to another point B goes through infinitely many intervals so how is he able to reach point B?</p>      <p class=\\"tc\\"><img class=\\"blogImg\\" src=\\"http://personal.lse.ac.uk/robert49/ebooks/PhilSciAdventures/img/Achilles.gif\\" alt=\\"\\"></p>      <h3>Explanation</h3>      <p>The answer to this is something to do with our conception of infinity.There are divergent series and convergent series. The most obvious divergent series is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 … There’s no answer to that equation. Or, more precisely, the answer is “infinity.” If Achilles had to cover these sorts of distances over the course of the race—in other words, if the tortoise were making progressively larger gaps rather than smaller ones—Achilles would never catch the tortoise.</p>      <p>Now consider the series 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 … Although the numbers go on forever, the series converges, and the solution is 1. As long as Achilles is making the gaps smaller at a sufficiently fast rate, so that their distances look more or less like this equation, he will complete the series in a measurable amount of time and catch the tortoise.</p>      <h2 id=\\"banach-tarski-paradox\\">Banach-Tarski Paradox</h2>      <p>In 1924 <strong>STEFAN  BANACH</strong> and <strong>ALFRED TARSKI</strong> two polish mathematicians stunned the mathematical community by presenting a mathematical sound proof of the following assertion :</p>      <p><em>It is theoritically possible to cut a solid ball into 9 pieces and by reassembling them,without ever stretching or wrapping the pieces, form <strong>TWO</strong> solid balls,each exactly the same size and shape as the original.</em></p>  <p>This statement is a proven mathematical fact that is beyond our understanding of how area and volume should behave for us <strong>the volume of a finite quantity should not double after rearranging its pieces !</strong></p>      <p>Why can’t this be done in real life, say, with a block of gold?</p>      <p>What mathematicians  have come to realize is that “area” is not a well-defined concept:not every shape in a plane can be assigned an area(nor can every solid in three-dimensional space be assigned a volume).There exist certain non-measurable sets about which speaking of there area is meaningless.The nine pieces used in the Banach-Tarski paradox turn out to be such non-measurable sets and so speaking of their volume is invalid.(They are extremely jagged shapes,FRACTAL in nature and impossible to physically cut out.)</p>      <p>Our simple intuitive understanding of area,works well in all practical applications.The material presented in a typical high-school and college cirriculum, for example,is sound.However,the Banach-Tarakshi paradox points out that extreme care must be taken when exploring the theoritical subteleties of area and volume in greater detail.</p>      <h4 id=\\"try-and-figure-out-the-maths-behind-it-with-this-paper-written-by-tom-weston\\">Try and figure out the Maths behind it with this paper written by <strong>Tom Weston</strong></h4>      <style>   .embed-container {     position: relative;

This angle will be the same as the angle ‘B’.Once we know angle ‘B’ we can divide 360 by that angle and multiply the ratio by the distance from the well to the obelisk (i. e., Syrine to Alexandri) and we’ll have the circumference of the earth.</p>  <p>We don’t have Eratosthenes’ original paper (or rather, his papyrus) so we don’t know the exact numbers he had. But we do know if he had used a 20.7264 meter obelisk it would have thrown a shadow that was 2.616 meters long.</p>  <p>Using <strong>Trigonometry</strong> we know:</p>  <p>tan(∠ A) = opposite / adjacent = s / h;  This means if the shadow is 2.616 meters and the obelisk is 20.7264 meter, the tangent of the angle ∠ ADE = 2.616/20.7264 = 0.1262.</p>  <p>If you look up the angle for that tangent - that is the arctangent of 0.1265 - you find the angle is 7.2 degree(approx.)</p>  <p>But since ∠ A and ∠ B are alternate angles from of the parallel sun’s rays. So we know that,</p>  <p><strong>∠ A = 7.2 degrees = ∠ B</strong></p>  <p>Now degrees are not absolute numbers but are relative values of how much of the circle the angle spans. For instance an angle of 36 degrees spans 100 × 36/360 = 10 % of the circle.</p>  <p>So from Eratosthenes’ calculation we know that 7.2 degrees spans the arc of the earth’s circumference that runs from Aswan to Alexandria. So the percentage of a circle between the two cities is:</p>  <p><strong>100 × 7.2 / 360 = 2 %</strong></p>  <p>So the distance from Aswan to Alexandria is 2%(1/50th) of the total circumference of the earth.</p>  <p>=&gt; <strong>Circumference of the Earth = 50 × 500 miles = 25,000 miles   thats 40233.6 km.</strong></p>  <p>According to the most recent value from NASA, the circumference of the Earth is <strong>40,075 km</strong>.That’s only  a percent off!</p>  <p><strong>Fun Fact</strong>:</p>  <p><img class=\\"blogImg\\" src=\\"/assets/images/chris.png\\" alt=\\"GitHub Logo\\"> When <strong>Christopher Columbus</strong> went to explore the world he also calculated the size of the earth.

When researching prime numbers, mathematicians are always being both prosaic and practical.</p>  <p><strong>Jason Davies</strong>, a data visualization specialist and computer scientist, created a model to show a link between various primes .  <img class=\\"blogImg\\" src=\\"http://a.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/codesign/imagecache/inline-zoom/post-inline/prime-number-96.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\"></p>  <p><a href=\\"https://www.jasondavies.com/primos/\\"><em>Go to his website-&gt;</em></a></p>  <h2 id=\\"different-prime-number-sieves\\">Different Prime Number Sieves</h2>  <h2 id=\\"sieve-of-eratosthenes\\"><em>Sieve of Eratosthenes</em></h2> <p class=\\"tc\\"><img class=\\"blogImg\\" src=\\"/assets/images/Eratosthene.01.png\\" alt=\\"GitHub logo\\"> Eratosthenes was a Greek mathematician, geographer, poet, astronomer, and music theorist yes,all of this in his life span of 80 years.He was responsible for finding one of the easiest methods for generating primes having a time complexity of O(n log log n) and space complexity of O(n)</p>  <p>Steps involved for generating primes less than or equal to the integer <strong>‘N’</strong>:</p>  <p>1.Make a list of all the integers less than or equal to n (and greater than one)</p>  <p>2.Taking out the first number in the list say x(i.e 2,initially) strike out all the multiples of x where x&lt;=N in the list(when a number is striked it no longer belongs to the list) and x is added to the list of primes.</p>  <p>3.Repeat 2nd step for the next value of x till x&lt;=N</p>  <p>4.The remaining elements of the list are the required prime numbers.</p>  <p><strong>An Example where N is equal to 120</strong> <img class=\\"blogImg\\" src=\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes_animation.gif\\" alt=\\"\\"></p>  <p>Try writing a program using the above method.</p>  <hr>  <h2 id=\\"sieve-of-sp-sundaram\\"><em>Sieve of SP Sundaram</em></h2>  <p>SP Sundaram was an Indian Mathematician of 1930’s who developed this method that uses Airithmetic sequences for generating primes.</p>  <p><strong>Method</strong></p>  <p>Start with 4 and create an arithmetic sequence by repeatedly adding three… 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22… In the second row, start with seven, and add five each time 7, 12, 17, 22, 27,…. continue starting with each number in the first sequence as the initial term, and to each sequence add the next consecutive odd number…</p>  <p>It looks like this</p>  <p>4  7  10  13  16  19  22  25  28</p>  <p>7  12  17  22  27  32  37  42  47</p>  <p>10  17  24  31  38  45  52  59  66</p>  <p>13  22  31  40  49  58  67  76  85</p>  <p>16  27  38  49  60  71  82  93  104</p>  <p>You may observe that the numbers in the first row are the same as in the first column and so are the numbers in second row and second column and so on.</p>  <p>Clearly in this matrix some numbers are prime and others are not.

This post is for one of such toys. To understand all about <strong>Xiralback</strong> lets first look at rattleback.</p>  <h2 id=\\"whats-a-rattleback\\">What’s a Rattleback?</h2>  <p>Well, rattleback is a desk toy that looks like a pebble which on being rotated on a surface such as a table top would continue to spin in one direction which could be either clockwise or anti-clockwise while when rotated in the other direction would resist its movement and then try to go back in its preferred direction.</p>  <style> .embed-container {   position: relative;   padding-bottom: 56.25%;   height: 0;   overflow: hidden;   max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed {   position: absolute;   top: 0;   left: 0;   width: 100%;   height: 100%; } </style>  <div class=\\"embed-container\\">   <iframe title=\\"YouTube video player\\" width=\\"640\\" height=\\"390\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/69Xm762qE8o\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\"></iframe> </div>  <p>The video would have helped you get a feel of this toy its unique rotating property makes it all the more interesting.In the above rattle back the toy is stable in anti clockwise while unstable in clockwise direction this is because the portion of the toy in contact with the table top is not a half cut ellipsoid but an <strong>S</strong> like surface which makes the toy behave in this manner.</p>      <style> div.scroll {     background-color: pink;     width: 700px;     height: 700px;     overflow: scroll; }  div.hidden {     background-color: white;     width: 10px;     height: 10px;     overflow: hidden; } </style>       <h2 id=\\"now-lets-get-to-xiralback\\">Now lets get to Xiralback…</h2> <p>The χiralback is a variation of a rattleback, it has a strong preference for which direction it spins. If spun in the reverse direction, it converts its energy into a rattle, and then spins back in the preferred direction. This behavior seems to defy the physical law requiring the conservation of angular momentum. The strength of the effect varies on the surface on which it is spun.</p>  <p>Older explanations of rattlebacks have focussed on surface asymmetries near the place where the bottom of the rattleback rests.But the surface of this one is a <strong>symmetrical ellipsoid given by the equation x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 + z^2/c^2 = 1</strong>.</p>  <p>It also has the property that if it is turned upside down, then the preferred direction of spin is reversed!  So we call it a χiralback.</p>  <p><strong>A Demonstration and Production video of the toy</strong></p> <style> .embed-container {   position: relative;   padding-bottom: 56.25%;   height: 0;   overflow: hidden;   max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed {   position: absolute;   top: 0;   left: 0;   width: 100%;   height: 100%; } </style>  <div class=\\"embed-container\\">   <iframe title=\\"YouTube video player\\" width=\\"640\\" height=\\"390\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s5Of6VhmhCI?t=37\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\"></iframe> </div>  <p>The man resposible for this toy is <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadashi_Tokieda\\"><strong>Mr.Tadashi François Tokieda</strong></a> a Japanese mathematician, specializing in mathematical physics,<strong>Director of Studies in Mathematics</strong> at Trinity Hall, Cambridge</p>  <p class=\\"tc\\"><img class=\\"blogImg\\" src=\\"https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/sites/radcliffe.harvard.edu/files/styles/large_body/public/imagefield_crop/field_image/person/tadashi-tokieda_photo-by-tony-rinaldo_373px_0.jpg?itok=wNvhJkK4\\" alt=\\"\\"></p>  <h4 id=\\"if-you-enjoyed-this-post-id-be-very-grateful-if-youd-help-it-spread-by-emailing-it-to-a-friend-or-sharing-it-on-twitter-or-facebook-thank-you\\">If you enjoyed this post, I’d be very grateful if you’d help it spread by emailing it to a friend, or sharing it on Twitter or Facebook.
