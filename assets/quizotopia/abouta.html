			<h1>ABOUT THE GAME</h1>
		<b>QUIZUTOP<span style="color:red">i</span>A</b> is a quiz game designed in the form of a web application. The purpose of creating this game was to deepen my understanding of the subject of web designing, precisely the languages-HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Using the aforementioned tools, QUIZUTOPiA brings the enjoyable activity
         of quizzing and the concept of online gaming together.

The game requires a player to answer a set of questions from one of the given categories of History,

Geography, MELA or Science, in stipulated time. At the end of the game, the player would be awarded

points based on his responses.

Styling of the game pages has been done using Cascading style sheets (CSS), orientation of the text and

questions has been set using Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), whereas logic involved in timer and

calculation of points has been developed using JavaScript.

It is hoped that the game will be thoroughly enjoyed by anyone interested in quizzing.
